# ajax-and-json

**Author**: Jimmy Chang and Mike Castor
**Version**: 1.0.0 (increment the patch/fix version number up if you make more commits past your first submission)

## Overview
This project is a exercise in building storage into a web application.  The goals were to add local storage and retrieve data from a JSON file that exists in a local file.

## Getting Started
Fork the github repo and clone to your local machine.  Once you've downloaded the files, everything is connected and should work once you load index.html from a local server.

## Architecture
This project is built using javascript, jquery, handlebars.js, html and css.  

## Change Log
01-01-2001 4:59pm - Application now has a fully-functional express server, with GET and POST routes for the book resource.

03-20-18 9:30am - Built functionality to connect to local storage.  
03-20-18 11:30am - Built functionality to asynchronous data/rendering.

## Credits and Collaborations
Thanks to Shannon Dillon for support and guidance as well as Sam Hamm's AJAX demo.
